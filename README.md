# EnrolleeExample# Hi there! 🐱‍🏍

We're excited for you to be taking our coding challenge! 

# The challenge

Using Spring Boot or Go, and your database of choice (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB -- any you'd like), develop a microservice for tracking the status of enrollees in a health care program.
- Enrollees must have an id, name, and activation status (true or false), and a birth date
- Enrollees may have a phone number (although they do not have to supply this)
- Enrollees may have zero or more dependents
- Each of an enrollee's dependents must have an id, name, and birth date

The application we will be building will need to be able to do these things:
- Add a new enrollee
- Modify an existing enrollee
- Remove an enrollee entirely
- Add dependents to an enrollee
- Remove dependents from an enrollee
- Modify existing dependents
